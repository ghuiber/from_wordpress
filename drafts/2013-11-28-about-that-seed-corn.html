<p>There's an interview with Alan Krueger in today's WSJ. The piece that inspired this post is <a href="http://pllqt.it/5sJ8j8">here</a>.</p>
<p>It's received wisdom -- for good reason, I am sure -- both that a bunch of stuff we take for granted started out as government-funded research and that not all research will bear fruit, and that's just the way it is. You still want somebody to fund these moonshots, because the projects that do bear fruit more than make up for the cost of those that do not, and you can't tell ahead of time which is which. The higher the uncertainty, the fewer the takers for funding the venture, the wisdom goes, so we might as well enlist the government as a backer of last resort. The competition for funds is fierce, which all but guarantees that the best researchers win, so the system is well set up to make good use of whatever taxpayer money it gets. Alright.</p>
<p>Somebody should do some historic research on the accuracy of credit-taking for the projects claimed to be of the fruit-bearing kind. They might test the method by showing the thread of evidence, for example, that the Internet is the direct descendant of Arpanet, so we're good; credit was taken rightly. That may not be very interesting, but it'd be worth the chuckle if it turned out that the government did look into horizontal drilling in the 70's, but gave up on the whole thing and everybody involved moved on to other topics. Now, of course, horizontal drilling is getting us gas and oil we didn't think we could have, so here comes the government holding it up as an example of its own usefulness as seed corn trustee in chief.</p>
<p>As it is, I'm not sure that the people running the government programs that fund basic research are immune to empty credit-claiming.</p>
