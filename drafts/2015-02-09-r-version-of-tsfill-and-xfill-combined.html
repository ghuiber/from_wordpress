<p>Suppose you have an unbalanced panel with daily data observed at the zip code level, with some zip codes (labeled <code>zip.cd</code>) not having any records on some days (labeled <code>cal.dt</code>). Suppose also that these zip codes are clustered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market">DMA's</a> (labeled <code>dma.cd</code>).</p>
<p>Suppose now that you want it balanced so all zip code + date combinations show up, with missing values filled in as needed. And you also want all zip code + date combinations to have a DMA code associated with them.</p>
<p>If this panel were a Stata data set, the <code>xtset</code> command would make Stata recognize it as a panel, and then <code>tsfill, full</code> would take care of the first half of the problem. This would leave you with some missing values for <code>dma.cd</code>, corresponding to zip code + date combinations not observed in the original data set. You would fill these in with <a href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com/stata/"><code>xfill</code></a> for the complete solution. This is both elegant and well-documented elsewhere.</p>
<p>If your panel is a <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html">data table</a> <code>x</code>, the function below is one way to solve both halves of the problem in one call:</p>
<pre><code>myXTFill &lt;- function(x) {
  dt     &lt;- copy(x)
  xtkeys &lt;- c('zip.cd','cal.dt')
  clkeys &lt;- c('zip.cd','dma.cd')
  xtfull &lt;- CJ(unique(x[,zip.cd]),unique(x[,cal.dt]))
  clfull &lt;- unique(subset(x,select=c(zip.cd,dma.cd)))
  setnames(xtfull,c('V1','V2'),xtkeys)
  setkeyv(xtfull,xtkeys)
  setkeyv(dt,xtkeys)
  setkeyv(clfull,clkeys)
  xtfull &lt;- subset(merge(xtfull,dt,all=TRUE),select=-dma.cd)
  xtfull &lt;- merge(xtfull,clfull,all=TRUE)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use it at your own risk.</p>
