<p>This is how I did it. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:<br />
- <a href="http://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode">XCode with command line tools</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">MacPorts</a><br />
- cmake, autoconf, automake, libtool, libusb*, rtl-sdr</p>
<p>All programs listed on the last item above came from MacPorts**, with <code>sudo port install PROGRAM</code> with the exception of libusb. The first four on the list are required for compiling the last two from source -- and in that order, because rtl-sdr depends on libusb. Unfortunately, compiling from source did not work for me: rtl-sdr kept failing to find libusb. Installing them from MacPorts did the trick. Upshot: save yourself some trouble, use MacPorts. Other upshot: it's entirely possible that if you get rtl-sdr from MacPorts you don't need any of the first five programs in that list.</p>
<p>&#42; For libusb I did <code>sudo port install libusb +universal</code> because of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/issues/detail?id=44">this thread</a>.</p>
<p>** After you install MacPorts you can check <code>port version</code> but <em>you have to do it in a fresh terminal window</em>. You will find it, then you can do <code>sudo port selfupdate</code> just to get into the habit. Three more things:<br />
 1. Every single thing you install with <code>sudo port install</code> will have to be launched from a fresh terminal window.<br />
 2. Do <code>sudo port selfupdate</code> often.<br />
 3. See also your other <code>sudo port</code> options: <code>clean</code>, <code>uninstall</code>, <code>upgrade</code>.</p>
<p>I think I'm on my way to putting this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JQZU1ZO/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1422775781&sr=1&keywords=nooelec">thing</a> to use. See below:</p>

<p>Alright, I'm sure that this "No E4000 tuner found, aborting." is some cause for concern, but this note is about getting started.</p>
