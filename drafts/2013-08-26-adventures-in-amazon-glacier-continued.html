<p>After trying without luck to upload a 1.2G tarball with <a href="https://github.com/uskudnik/amazon-glacier-cmd-interface">glacier-cmd</a>, I asked around and found <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a>. I installed it on my Mac and filled out an /etc/boto.cfg file with my AWS credentials.</p>
