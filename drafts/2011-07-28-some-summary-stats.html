<p>I wrote this at the time of the public-sector labor protests in Madison, WI. It stayed in the draft folder because as the street protests petered out, so did my interest in the matter. Then, months later, <a href="http://www.antolin-davies.com/conventionalwisdom/lobbying.pdf">I got scooped</a>. That'll teach me to sit on a good story, so here goes:</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://tomgpalmer.com">Tom Palmer</a> shared <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php?type=A">this list of the top 140 campaign donors over the past 20 years</a> on Facebook a while back. I got the data and did a bit of adding up.</p>
<p>First, you should know that angry public sector employees do not take to the streets lightly. When you outspend Goldman Sachs by almost a 4:3 ratio, you're right to be shocked when you don't get no respect. Here's a picture of how generous both of them are compared to the median top donor, which is the red horizontal line at the $12 million mark:</p>
<p><a href="http://enoriver.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/top_donors_1989_2010.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1497" title="top_donors_1989_2010" src="assets/top_donors_1989_2010.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Job security in the public sector is legendary. Judging by this picture, it doesn't come cheaply, though it's possible that I'm being overly cynical here: since 98% of the public sector unions' money goes to Democrats, this may be true love, not cold calculation. The Democrats, by the way, have far more generous friends among the top 140 donors than the Republicans do:</p>

\begin{tabular}{ l l }<br />

\multicolumn{2}{ c }{How the loot was split} \\<br />
\hline<br />

\$ 1,293,080,241 &amp; \$ 858,606,177 \\<br />
\hline<br />
\end{tabular}<br />
[/latex]</p>
<p>Where does this big Democratic advantage come from? I grouped the donors into business, labor, and issue-based or partisan PAC's. All but two fit in one of these three categories. The exceptions are FreddieMac and FannieMae. I had no idea that they contributed to political campaigns. Aren't they supposed to be some kind of public institutions? Here's the split:</p>
<p>[latex]<br />
\begin{tabular}{ l r }<br />
\hline<br />
\hline<br />
\multicolumn{2}{ c }{Donors by interest} \\<br />
\hline<br />
Business &amp; 100 \\<br />
Labor &amp; 31 \\<br />
Partisan PAC or issue advocacy &amp; 7 \\<br />
Quasi-government entity &amp; 2 \\<br />
\hline<br />
Total &amp; 140 \\<br />
\hline<br />
\end{tabular}<br />
[/latex]</p>
<p>Once you have this classification, you can add up the dollars across the groups and they work out like this:</p>
<p>[latex]<br />
\begin{tabular}{ l r r }<br />
\hline<br />
\hline<br />
&amp; Democrats &amp; Republicans \\<br />
\hline<br />
Business &amp; \$ 610,577,785 &amp; \$ 781,558,687 \\<br />
Labor &amp; \$ 571,023,603 &amp; \$ 39,275,544 \\<br />
Partisan PAC or issue advocacy &amp; \$ 102,740,769 &amp; \$ 28,509,923 \\<br />
Quasi-government entity &amp; \$ 8,738,084 &amp; \$ 9,262,023 \\<br />
\hline<br />
Total &amp; \$ 1,293,080,241 &amp; \$ 858,606,177 \\<br />
\hline<br />
\end{tabular}<br />
[/latex]</p>
<p>Clearly, the Democrats' Big Labor friends put to shame the Republican advantage with Big Business. Even so, the size of the latter surprised me. I expected that Big Business, like the quasi-government bureaucrats at Freddie and Fannie, would spread the love more evenly.</p>
<p>I define Big Business and Big Labor as those interest groups that are among the 140 biggest donors here. So, I mean that they're big in how much they contribute to political campaigns, not in their share of the US economy, though I do expect some positive correlation between the two.</p>
<p>I was also curious about the breakdown by industry of the 100 Big Business donors. My guess was that the total volume of donations would be a direct function of both the industry's size and its regulatory burden. Bigger industries contribute more, and more regulated industries probably kiss the ring with greater fervor.</p>
<p>There's also some interaction of the two, I expect: within the most heavily regulated industries, the biggest firms probably give the most. The interaction mechanism would go like this: the goal is not to get the regulator off your back; that is not an option. What you can do if you're a big firm is make your regulators look statesmanlike by helping them craft legislation in consultation with stakeholders. That is a reliably nice-sounding way to regulate. A big firm that helps out can avoid bad press, might even get to look like a responsible corporate citizen, and might get a chance to sneak in provisions that make life harder for its competitors. For this to work, the regulator doing the crafting must be a friend, so the firm contributes accordingly. This, I expect, is a game that the biggest players play best. So, in sum, I expect that the Big Business donors are large companies from within heavily regulated large industries.</p>
<p>With these speculations in mind, below is the industry breakdown of the 100 Big Business donors, along with their contributions:</p>

<p>I was not surprised that the financial sector was so well represented. I was surprised that the accountants (as in KPMG, Deloitte, etc.) spent about as much as the defense contractors did. More in line with popular belief, the lawyers clearly love the Democrats. The biggest among the three contributors in the Legal group is the trial lawyers' association. Media is the only other industry whose biggest donors lean Democratic. Both these findings are in line with popular belief as well. No Republican-leaning industry is as devoted to the cause as the lawyers are to their Democratic friends, in relative terms, but the building trade does come close. I guess the mortgage deduction is safe, then. The other Republican BFF's are the people in the drug, alcohol and tobacco trades. Who knew?</p>
<p>The 9 donors lumped into "Other" are listed below. They ended up here for convenience. Microsoft would be alone in an industry named Software, because that's how big it is relative to all other donors in that field. GE has its fingers in too many different things to be easily associable with any one industry.</p>

<p>It's not easy to check these industries' share of either the US GDP or the total regulatory burden, so I'm not going to. The former could be dug up from census data, I guess, but the latter is trickier. You'd have to settle first on a way to measure it. If you're curious about testing the relationship between donations, industry size and regulatory burden that I'm talking about, and you think a paper might come out of it, let me know. My data and Stata code might save you a little work.</p>
<p>Finally, I had a closer look at labor-affiliated donors. Stereotyping with abandon, if you vote Democratic, you probably see Labor engaged in epic struggle against Capital. The monies collected from the working stiffs buy electioneering help for sundry community organizers who go on to become brave politicians who then might crack the whip over the fat cats' rumps. If you can relate, then these are your top 10 heroes:</p>

<p>If you add together the two teacher unions, America's underpaid and overworked easily rise to the top spot -- I mean the very top, outspending ActBlue and AT&amp;T. Next in line are government workers.</p>
<p>If you look at it this way, then the first $100 million of the $400 million Democratic advantage among the largest donors comes from public school teachers and government workers. I don't think the cats employing them are that fat these days.</p>
